Background:

This website was completely built in june 2018 as a Demo website. 
My aunt had a small business where she sells Herbs and Spices. She needed support to sell her products online to get large orders and reach out to her customers. Therefore, I have asked I can help her and built this DEMO website in order to show her, how her website would actually look like and what are facilities she can have. 
The method of payment and order was done through email as she finds it easier to communicate to her customer through email by receiving the order and delivering them, then getting paid by hand. Which is almost like the delivery order for any fast food shops. 
Therefore, because it was a demo website to here the abilities, this did not contain any complex facilities. 
Hope it Helps!!
